# Git-for-Ideas

## What is it?

**Git-for-Ideas** is an AI-powered document evolution tracking system that helps users understand how their writing changes over time and enhance their writing using AI agents.

Think of it as **Git for your thoughts** - version control meets AI-assisted writing.

## Problem Statement

Writers, researchers, and knowledge workers struggle to:
- Track how their ideas evolve over time
- Understand what changes were made and why
- Get intelligent feedback on their writing
- Maintain multiple branches of thought experiments

Git-for-Ideas provides:
- **Version Control**: Like Git, but optimized for prose and ideas
- **AI Analysis**: Understand the semantic changes, not just text diffs

- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for analysis and suggestions
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend)

## Key Features

### 1. Document Versioning
