# How Git-for-Ideas Stores the Evolution of Thought

*A look inside the architecture that turns writing into a living history.*


Most writing tools treat text as a flat document — a single state overwritten again and again.
Git-for-Ideas works differently. It treats writing as something alive. Something that **bends**, **diverges**, **returns**, and **grows** as your thinking develops.


This article explains how the database captures that evolution.
No code. No schemas. Just a clear, intuitive breakdown of the system that powers meaningful versioning, branching, diffing, and real-time feedback.

# 1️⃣ A Database Built for Meaning, Not Keystrokes


In Git-for-Ideas, the system pays attention to **semantic change**.
Instead of asking *"What did the user edit?"*, it asks **"Has the meaning shifted?"**


To answer this, the backend evaluates **four forms of drift** whenever you write:

- 🌍 **Global drift** — how the overall document meaning changes
- 📝 **Local drift** — paragraph-level differences detected via embeddings
- 📊 **Cumulative drift** — small shifts adding up over time
- ⚠️ **Contradiction drift** — reversals or breaks in earlier logic


Only when these signals cross a threshold does the system decide that the idea has moved in a meaningful way.


That moment becomes a **new version**.


Everything else flows through **real-time insights**.


---


# 2️⃣ Projects: The Home of a Document's Lifecycle


A **project** represents a single document — a long-form essay, a chapter, a note, a planning doc.


It serves as the **container** for everything that evolves inside it:

- **versions**
- **branches**
- **diffs**
- **writing insights**
- **background jobs**
- **cached embeddings**


All activity in the system anchors to the project.

# 3️⃣ Versions: Snapshots of Meaningful Change


**Versions** are the core of the architecture.
But unlike traditional editors, versions aren't created on every save or keystroke.


A version is created only when the **meaning** of your writing has drifted enough to matter.


## 📦 Each version stores:

- The **full text** at that moment
- **Paragraph segmentation** and paragraph embeddings
- An automatically generated **short node title**
- The **parent version** it descended from
- The **branch** it belongs to (if any)
- A human-readable **"shift narrative"** generated by the AI


Versions form a **tree**, not a flat list.


If you restore an older version and continue writing, the system interprets that as **returning to an earlier idea**.
A new branch forms at that point.


---


# 4️⃣ How the System Decides a Version Should Exist


Here's the simplified lifecycle:

1. You **submit new content**.
2. The system **computes drift signals** by comparing the new text to the previous version.
3. If the change is small, **real-time suggestions update** — but no version is created.
4. If the change is meaningful, a **new version is created automatically**.


This ensures your version history is filled only with **useful snapshots** rather than noisy micro-edits.


---


# 5️⃣ Diffs: Understanding What Changed


When a new version is created, the system computes a **semantic diff** between:

**the parent version → the new version**


## 🔍 Each diff contains:

- A **similarity score**
- **Drift signals**
- A **drift category** (minor, moderate, major)
- An automatically generated **summary of what changed**


Diffs power the **evolution graph**, showing how ideas shifted and why.


The important detail:
> **Diffs follow versions — they don't trigger them.**


This keeps the flow intuitive and predictable.


---


# 6️⃣ Branches: A Tree of Exploration


In Git-for-Ideas, **branching** reflects your creative exploration.


## 🌿 Branches form when:

- You **restore an older version**
- You **begin writing from that point**
- A new sequence of versions **grows from that restored node**


This mirrors a version control system:
thoughts diverge, explore an alternate direction, and form a **branch in the version tree**.


Branches aren't created automatically by drift.
They only arise through **user-driven forking**.


---


# 7️⃣ Background Jobs: Handling Heavy AI Work


Some tasks are too heavy to run during a normal request — for example, generating a detailed narrative explaining how your content evolved.


To keep the editor fast, the system sends these tasks to a **background job queue**.


## ⚙️ The job system ensures:

- ✅ Only **one active job per project**
- ✅ Duplicate jobs **collapse into the same output**
- ✅ Retries return the **original result**, not a new one


It guarantees **reliability** and **consistency**, even if a user pastes multiple times or the network hiccups.


---


# 8️⃣ Caching: The Engine of Performance


Two caching layers make the experience fast:


## 🗄️ Embedding Cache

Stores **paragraph embeddings** keyed by hashed text.
If the same paragraph appears again (even across projects), the system **never recomputes the embedding**.


## 💡 Insight Cache

Stores **writing insights** mapped to content hashes.
This keeps **real-time writing feedback responsive** even in large documents.


Together, these caches dramatically **reduce cost and computation**.


---


# 9️⃣ Idempotency: Clean Data Under All Conditions


Real users paste text twice.
Browsers retry requests.
Connections drop mid-write.


To handle this, Git-for-Ideas uses **two layers of idempotency**:

- 🔐 **Job idempotency** prevents duplicate background tasks.
- 🔐 **Version idempotency** ensures the same operation never creates two versions.


This preserves the integrity of your version graph — **one version for one meaningful change, always**.


---


# 🔟 The Database as a Mirror of Thinking


When you zoom out, the architecture **mirrors the way ideas unfold**:

- ✅ **Versions** capture moments where meaning changes.
- ✅ **Branches** reflect alternate paths of thought.
- ✅ **Diffs** explain how and why an idea shifted.
- ✅ **Caches** preserve momentum while writing.
- ✅ **Idempotency** keeps the graph clean and trustworthy.


It's a database designed not just to **store text**, but to store **the evolution of ideas** — faithfully, efficiently, and intelligibly.


Your writing becomes a **navigable history**.
Your thinking becomes a **graph**.
Your document becomes a **living system**.
