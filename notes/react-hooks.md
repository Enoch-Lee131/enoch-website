# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

This simple API replaces the need for class-based state management and makes components more readable.

## useEffect Hook

`useEffect` handles side effects in functional components:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

The dependency array ensures the effect only runs when specific values change.

## Custom Hooks

Creating custom hooks allows you to extract and reuse stateful logic:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    return localStorage.getItem(key) || initialValue;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, value);
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue];
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always call hooks at the top level** - Don't call them inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Use the exhaustive-deps rule** - Include all dependencies in useEffect
3. **Extract complex logic into custom hooks** - Keep components clean and focused
4. **Name custom hooks with "use" prefix** - Follow React conventions

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful way to write cleaner, more maintainable code. By understanding these patterns, you can build more efficient React applications.
